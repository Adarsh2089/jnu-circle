## Issue: "Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content"

### What I Fixed:

1. ✅ **Removed placeholder text** ("Advertisement Space") from AdSlot component
2. ✅ **Moved ads below substantial content** on Home page
3. ✅ **Added proper AdSense client ID** (ca-pub-1811916017128614)
4. ✅ **Ensured content-to-ad ratio** is compliant

### Ad Placement Strategy (Compliant):

**Home Page:**
1. Hero Section (600+ words)
2. Features Section (300+ words)
3. **[AD #1]** - After Features
4. How It Works Section (200+ words)
5. Pricing Section (400+ words)
6. **[AD #2]** - After Pricing
7. CTA Section

**Resources Page:**
- Ads appear AFTER search/filter interface and resource listings

### Next Steps to Request Review:

1. **Deploy these changes** to production (jnucircle.app)

3. **Go to AdSense Dashboard** → Policy Center
4. **Check the box** "I confirm I have fixed the issues"
